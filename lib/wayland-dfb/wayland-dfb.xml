  Sent when this wl_buffer is no longer used by the compositor.
  The client is now free to re-use or destroy this buffer and its
  backing storage.

  If a client receives a release event before the frame callback
  requested in the same wl_surface.commit that attaches this
  wl_buffer to a surface, then the client is immediately free to
  re-use the buffer and its backing storage, and does not need a
  second buffer for the next surface content update. Typically
  this is possible, when the compositor maintains a copy of the
  wl_surface contents, e.g. as a GL texture. This is an important
  optimization for GL(ES) compositors with wl_shm clients.
