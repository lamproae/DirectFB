# How to compile the cle266 driver:

# 1a. Build the kernel module. You will have to install it
# (with insmod) before you run a directfb application.
# Your kernel must also use devfs.
# The module file is named cle266vgaio.o (or .ko on 2.6 kernels)

# If you use a 2.4 kernel, write

make -f cle266vgaio.mk v24 

# If you use a 2.6 kernel, write

make -f cle266vgaio.mk v26

# 1b. Optionally, you can patch your 2.4 kernel. (Sorry, I have no patch
for 2.6) See Patching.txt
